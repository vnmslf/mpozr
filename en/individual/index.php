<br>
 You can order individual sewing of uniforms from the assortment of the ZOLOTOE RUNO factory and from the assortment presented on this website.
 </br></br>
 When placing an order for individual sewing fill out the measurement sheet and send it to us. Be sure to indicate the current contact information by which the Factory manager will contact you. You should discuss with the manager the production time, cost, and, if necessary, delivery terms. The manage could also help in matters of correct taking measurements.
 </br></br>
 Be especially careful when taking measurements because in the case of sewing Goods with erroneously provided data from the customer, the factory is not responsible for it. The factory can guarantee the result of correct measurements only when the buyer contacts the Factory office directly. We recommend contacting the factory office or resorting to the help of specialists.
 </br></br>
 The term for making goods for individual sewing does not exceed the time for manufacturing products for standard measurements. You can take the finished goods away by yourself from the companyâ€™s office, or order delivery in any way convenient for you.
